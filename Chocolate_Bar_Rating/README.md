# Chocolate Bar Ratings

## Problem statement

## Context

Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billions pounds. However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean 
used and where the beans were grown.

### Flavors of Cacao Rating System:
- 5 = Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
- 4 = Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
- 3 = Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
- 2 = Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
- 1 = Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)


Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. 

### Inspiration

- Where are the best cocoa beans grown?
- Which countries produce the highest-rated bars?
- Whatâ€™s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?
